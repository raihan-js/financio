<!-- Add this permission to your AndroidManifest.xml file -->
<!-- This should be added inside the <manifest> tag but outside <application> -->

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS" />

<!-- 
Note: For Expo managed workflow, you would need to add this to app.json instead:

"expo": {
  "android": {
    "permissions": [
      "READ_SMS",
      "RECEIVE_SMS"
    ]
  }
}
